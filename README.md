# Projects

## This repository serves as a collection of my FreeCodeCamp projects along with future personal projects.
It will act as a record of my progress in web development and programming, while also showcasing my skills to potential employers.

Each project demonstrates different concepts Iâ€™ve learned and applied, from fundamental programming practices to building complete applications
